                <p>Linux was created in 1991 by Richard Stallman. It began as In 1983, Richard Stallman started a project to make a 
                GNU system that was intended to be a Unix-compatible operating system that was free to use. In 1991, Linus Torvald 
                was working on developing a kernel for accessing a hard drive. This kernel was called Linux and it was combined with 
                Stallman's GNU system to make the Linux operating system. Over the next few years, Torvald worked with volunteers 
                to create an improved, stable, kernel. By 2000, many companies had Linux support in some way, and the userbase is 
                continuing to expand.</p>
